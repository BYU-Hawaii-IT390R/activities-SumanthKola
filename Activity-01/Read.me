# Activity-01: Recursive Directory Scanner with Python

## üë®‚Äçüíª Overview
This project is a recursive Python script that scans a directory and its subdirectories for `.txt` files, calculates their sizes, and displays the results in a readable table. The script also includes a command-line enhancement to filter results by a minimum file size (in kilobytes).

There are two main scripts:

- `setup_files.py`: Generates a realistic test directory structure with `.txt` files for testing purposes.
- `scan.py`: Scans for `.txt` files and displays file size information, with the optional `--min-size` filter.

---

## ‚úÖ Enhancement Implemented: `--min-size`
This optional argument filters the scan results to show only `.txt` files larger than the specified number of kilobytes.

**Example Usage:**
```bash
python3 scan.py test_root --min-size 0.5
